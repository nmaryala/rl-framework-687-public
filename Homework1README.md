## Running instructions
This example will run ```homework1.py``` located in the ```homeworks``` directory (we will update this example after the first submission). In the ```rl-framework-687-public``` directory, run:

```
python -m homeworks.homework1

```
The main function will have four function calls.
Uncomment each function to run the code for the respective question and comment the other ones.
You can change the number of iterations you want to run the code for using the variable in Main().

## Example: 
If you want to run the solution code for Problem A in the homework, your main function should look something like:

def Main():
    num_iters = 10000
    problemA(num_iters)
    #problemC(num_iters)
    #problemD(num_iters)
    #problemE(num_iters)
